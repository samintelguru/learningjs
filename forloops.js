//a for loop is an iteration technique. to iterate is to repeate
//structure  for(when to start the loop;a condition to keep the loop running.; step in between each loop){code to be repeated/iterated;}
//a simple loop to count numbers from 1 to 10
//js uses a counter to keep track of the number of times an action is to be iterated. a counter is a number varibale.
// for (let counter = 1; counter <= 10; counter++){
//     console.log(counter);
// }

// for (let x = 10; x >=1; x--){
//     console.log(x);
// }

for (let y = 2; y <=10; y++){
    console.log(y);
    y++;

}

//print numbers from 20 to 1
//print odd numbers from 20 to 1 and in between 30 and 50
